        <p> Once a developer knows one of these 3 stacks, it won’t be too difficult to learn the others. All of these stacks are useful – it just depends on the type of project you’re taking on. 
            If a developer or team prefers to work with Angular, they may choose to work with the MEAN stack. Meanwhile, a developer or team who enjoys working with React will gravitate towards MERN. 

            MEAN stack vs. MERN stack vs. MEVN stack… which one is best? These stacks are all very similar, which is why we only teach one to Kenzie Software Engineering learners. Once a developer knows one of these 3 stacks, it won’t be too difficult to learn the others. All of these stacks are useful – it just depends on the type of project you’re taking on. 
            In short, one isn’t necessarily better than another.</p>
